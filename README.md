# TravelTide_perk_project

**TravelTide Customer Segmentation**

**Introduction**

In any business, understanding the customer behaviour is an important component. In business companies like TravelTide to retain their customers and make them buy regularly, they need to understand their customers behaviour and allocate perks.

**Specific Objectives**

1. Segment customers into distinct categories based on their previous trip booking history using unsupervised learning models.
   
2. Allocate a perk for each segment based on their unique behaviour

The project assumes that advertising booking to individual users with perk that likely interests them would increase the chance of trip booking.


**Tools Used in the project:**

Google colab, Excel for perk analysis

Beekeper Studio,

SQLAlchemy to connect to the Postgress database,

SQL, Panda, Numpy for analysis,

correlation matrix

Plotly express, seaborn, matplotlib for data visualization

MinMaxScaler, PCA, silhouette_score, KMeans, GaussianMixture

**Graphs:**

Generated on google golab during analysis and on Excel for description of the segments.

**Exported Datasets:**

Seven csv files exported: one for each segment. The 7th segment includes users who have never booked a trip.

One csv file that classifies the customers based on rules was exported after aggregation in colab.

**Executive summary report and presentaion:**

The executive summary report is included in the text cell of the google colab. 

The 5 min video presentation on the powerpoint is recorded and included in the report.
